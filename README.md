# Supervised Machine Learning for Predictive Analysis and Feature Selection: Crop Selection and Soil Health
Climate change is affecting nutrition and food security globally. Soils in the industrialized age have been pumped with fertilizers and soil health is necessary for long-term, productive agriculture. Soil provides nutrients and providers a certain stability to the crops planted by farmers.

Using a dummy dataset from DataCamp, we will explore a dataset containing crop data and the following soil measures:
- Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- Potassium content ratio in the soil
- pH value of the soil

Suppose you are working with a farmer that wants to focus on one of the four soil measures above due to budgetary constraints. This requires feature selection to pick the most important feature that predicts the best crop for the farmer's field.
